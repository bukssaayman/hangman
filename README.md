# NB:
This repo is over 4 years old. This game probably does not run anymore. I just dont have the time to dedicate to this. Look at the architecture, to get a sense of how this was built, but don't bother trying to run it :-)

 - In terminal root dir run: `composer install`
 - In the root project folder rename `.env.example` to `.env`
